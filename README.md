# "Go-Based Secure File Sharing and Management System with AWS S3 and PostgreSQL"- File Sharing & Management System üöÄ

## Overview

This project is a backend system designed for secure file sharing and management. Built using **Go (Golang)**, it integrates **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and **AWS S3** for efficient and scalable file handling. The system offers **user authentication**, **file upload/download capabilities**, **search functionality**, **rate limiting**, and **automatic cleanup** of expired files, all while ensuring secure file storage with encryption.

## üìå Features

- ‚úÖ **User Authentication (JWT-based)**: Secure login and registration with JWT tokens for user authentication.
  
- ‚úÖ **File Upload & Download (AWS S3)**: Secure file uploads to and downloads from AWS S3 storage.
  
- ‚úÖ **File Search**: Search files by **name**, **date**, and **type** for easy retrieval.
  
- ‚úÖ **Rate Limiting**: Limit to **100 requests per minute per user** to ensure fair usage and avoid server overload.
  
- ‚úÖ **Background Cleanup Job**: Automatically deletes expired files based on their expiration date to manage storage.
  
- ‚úÖ **File Encryption**: All files are encrypted before upload to ensure confidentiality and integrity.
  
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Upload Notifications (WebSockets)**: Push notifications to notify users when a file has been successfully uploaded.
